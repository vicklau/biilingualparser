# biilingualparser
A VBA Module to help parse a bilingual text (Chinese - English) in Microsoft Office separately into their respective language.

# Installation
Get into the _Developer_ Tab of your Microsoft Office application (presumably Excel/Word/Powerpoint) and Open the _Visual Basic Editor_.
From the _File_ menu, Import the code file into your Personal Macro File or the codesheet of your active document.  For your easy usage, you may optionally want to right-click your ribbon of the workspace and add a button linked to the parser macro by clicking _Customise Ribbon..._ and dragging the macro from the list given to your desired position of the ribbon.
